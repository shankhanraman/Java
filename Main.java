// main.java is class itself 
// Good practice would be the initilaizing the class name with the capital itself
// first class would be the public

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {//Static is used beacuse main is entry point so it's used to run withouth creating object 
        System.out.println("hello world");

    }
